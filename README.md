# Tic Tac Toe
## A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Html, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
